# RecipeHound #

RecipeHound is a CLI app that allows users to:
  - create and login to an account with a username and password.
  - The user is greeted with a menu of options after logging in, where they can:
    - search for recipes based on specific ingredients.
    - ask RecipeHound to give them a random recipe from the database.
    - save recipes to their account, and then create shopping lists of ingredients from their saved list of recipes.
    - shopping lists can be from a single recipe, or from all of the recipes saved by that User.
